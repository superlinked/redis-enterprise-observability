# Redis Enterprise Grafana Dashboards

This repository contains a collection of Grafana dashboards for [Redis Enterprise](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/) and [Redis 
Cloud](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/).
These dashboards rely on metrics exported by the Redis Enterprise and Redis Cloud Prometheus endpoints.

The dashboards are separated according Grafana version; older versions used a plugin from Angular which more recent versions do not. 

* For dashboards intended for use with versions 7-9 of Grafana, see [v7-9](dashboards/grafana_v7-9/README_v7-9.md)
* For dashboards intended for use with versions 9-11 of Grafana, see [v9-11](dashboards/grafana_v9-11/README_v9-11.md)
